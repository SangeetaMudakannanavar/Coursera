    "In this assignment, you will be required to explore, segment, and cluster the neighborhoods in the city of Toronto. However, unlike New York, the neighborhood data is not readily available on the internet. What is interesting about the field of data science is that each project can be challenging in its unique way, so you need to learn to be agile and refine the skill to learn new libraries and tools quickly depending on the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the Toronto neighborhood data, a Wikipedia page exists that has all the information we need to explore and cluster the neighborhoods in Toronto. You will be required to scrape the Wikipedia page and wrangle the data, clean it, and then read it into a pandas dataframe so that it is in a structured format like the New York dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the data is in a structured format, you can replicate the analysis that we did to the New York City dataset to explore and cluster the neighborhoods in the city of Toronto.\n",

    "More than one neighborhood can exist in one postal code area. For example, in the table on the Wikipedia page, you will notice that M5A is listed twice and has two neighborhoods: Harbourfront and Regent Park. These two rows will be combined into one row with the neighborhoods separated with a comma as shown in row 11 in the above table.\n",
    "If a cell has a borough but a Not assigned neighborhood, then the neighborhood will be the same as the borough. So for the 9th cell in the table on the Wikipedia page, the value of the Borough and the Neighborhood columns will be Queen's Park.\n",
